        <li>any pack of instant noodles (i like shin black)</li>
        <li>2-3 eggs</li>
        <li>chinese chili oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the instant noodles as per the instructions on the packet, cook in a wide skillet.</li>
        <li>Once noodles have softened, add eggs and cover.</li>
        <li>Once eggs have cooked to your desired doneness, add salt, pepper, and chili oil.</li>
