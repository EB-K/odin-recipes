    <h3>A Brief Tale</h3>
    <p>This <em>spectacular</em> pasta is the result of my brilliant ability of inputing minimum
        cooking effort and yielding maximum taste. 
    </p>
    <p>This dish tastes great wether you follow the recipe to the tee or play by your own
        rules, as long as you stick to the fundementals you'll be golden.
